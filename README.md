# qdbg
Quick debug - a pure Python3 command line utility for faster debugging 

## Introduction

Eliminate the wasted clicks and keystrokes involved with copying your error messages into a search bar. `qdbg` does this tedious task for you (and we know you do it a lot :wink:). Simply run any command, and when your program inevitably fails, `qdbg` will automatically open a search tab for you.

```bash
qdbg <cmd>
```

## Requirements

* Python 3.7+
* Linux or OSX operating system
* A developer that runs faulty programs


## Installation

### osx / linux (Recommended)

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hermgerm29/qdbg/main/get-qdbg.py | python -
```

## Documentation

Coming soon...


## Credits

`qdbg`'s installation script is heavily derived from [python-poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry).
